# RFID-BASED-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
In this project, the STM32F407 microcontroller and RC522 RFID module are used to detect student attendance. The RFID module is interfaced with the STM32F407 microcontroller using the SPI protocol to receive input from the RFID tags. The output is displayed on an LCD, which is connected to the microcontroller via the I2C protocol. A green LED is used to indicate that attendance has been marked, while a red LED is used to indicate a wrong card detection. When the user places a valid card near the RFID reader, the card is detected, the green LED glows, and the attendance information is displayed on the LCD. If an invalid card is detected, the red LED glows. The entire system is programmed in Embedded C.
